# CatFinderinator3000
Fun little multifaceted project that uses a variety of technologies I've touched down on in the past and/or wanted to use.

## Project overview
This system is composed of a computer with a camera, an object detection model trained on calico cats, code on the computer that will record a video if the camera using the model detects a calico cat, more code that will push the recorded video to a database, and a user phone with an app that can retrieve uploaded videos from the database.

At the most abstracted level, this is a visualization of the project.
